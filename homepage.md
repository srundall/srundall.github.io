## Inside Out 2

I really enjoyed _Inside Out 2_ honestly a lot more than I thought I would. The first film was not high on my list of favorite Pixar films, but the second one did a really empathetic portrayal of what it feels like to have an anxiety attack, and I thought that that was really special. I was glad I went to see it, and I'd watch it again.

## The Fall Guy

_The Fall Guy_ was one of my favorite movies I watched this year, so much so that I purchased the DVD once it became available. The comedy is thoughtful, the writing is silly but it has heart, and the visual effects are obviously very engaging. There was not a boring moment in this film, and I've seen it 3 times now since its initial release in June.

## Wicked

_Wicked_ was my favorite film this year. I cried at the end. I grew up loving musical theatre but never had seen or listened to _Wicked_ as a live show, but I made the effort to get to know the story before seeing it in theaters. I loved this film -- the sets and costumes were stunning, the singing blended very well, and it paid homage to both the original show as well as the story of _The Wizard of Oz_ in really beautiful ways.

## Bonhoeffer

I did not know what to expect going to see _Bonhoeffer_, and while I enjoyed it, it seemed like the film did not really know what tone it was supposed to use. The tagline is "Pastor. Spy. Assassin" and it couldn't really pick which of those to focus on or which was the most important, and that made it a bit of a tonally confusing movie to watch. I enjoyed it though, and the ending was very somber.
